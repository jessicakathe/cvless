# About


Welcome to my home page!!

I am a motivated Actuary and a Statistician, I have proven analytical, interpersonal and technical aptitudes and possess sound commercial awareness. I am proactive and highly focused with strong skills, an analytical approach to problem solving and adept at data handling.

I have prepared this website to show my work. [Click here](/cv) to see my full CV, and [here](/cv.pdf) to download a print version. I am building this website with a blog: [click here](/posts) to share knowledge from my experience.

---Finally, [click here](/404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).
